üõ†Ô∏è **Repositories**  
Haibu is open source, and we have several repositories available for contribution. Each repository has specific issues that we need help with, and we encourage developers to check out the available issues and get involved.

### Available Repositories:
- **[haibu-landing-page](https://github.com/haibu-project/haibu-landing-page)**: The official landing page of Haibu.
- **[haibu-frontend](https://github.com/haibu-project/haibu-frontend)**: The frontend code for the Haibu platform.
- **[haibu-backend](https://github.com/haibu-project/haibu-backend)**: The backend that powers the Haibu platform.
- **[haibu-clicks](https://github.com/haibu-project/haibu-clicks)**: Our first gamified campaign, where users can participate in activities and earn rewards.

If you're interested in contributing to any of these repositories, take a look at the open issues. You can apply by explaining how you would resolve the issue, who you are, and why you want to contribute.

Once you're assigned an issue, make sure to fork the repository and create a new branch depending on the task you're working on. For example, use:
- `feature/` for new features
- `fix/` for bug fixes
- etc.

If you have any questions or need help while contributing, feel free to join our Telegram group, where we are happy to support you: [t.me/haibusocial](https://t.me/haibusocial).
