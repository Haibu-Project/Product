# About Haibu 🐝🍯 

## 🚀 Product Overview  
Haibu is a decentralized social media platform built on the **Celestia network**, designed to provide a **secure, transparent, and community-driven** alternative to traditional social networks. Unlike centralized platforms that control content and decisions, Haibu operates with a DAO-like governance model, where users collectively make decisions about the platform's evolution.  

Our **mission** is to redefine social networking by giving users control over their data, interactions, and governance. Our **vision** is to create a social ecosystem where engagement is rewarded, community-driven moderation ensures fairness, and decentralization guarantees freedom of expression without reliance on a central authority.  

## 🌟 Key Features  
- **🗳️ DAO Governance:** Haibu is community-driven, meaning key decisions —such as feature implementations— are made through voting. Voting power is weighted based on user engagement and contribution levels.  
- **🏆 Gamified Engagement:** Users earn points by actively participating in the platform. As they accumulate points, they **level up**, gaining greater influence in governance decisions.  
- **💬 Familiar Social Interactions:** Post **"Hai"** (similar to tweets), like, comment, and share content while enjoying a decentralized and censorship-resistant experience.  
- **🔒 Blockchain-Powered Security:** Built on Celestia, Haibu ensures **data integrity, privacy, and protection against censorship**, unlike centralized platforms where data control is in the hands of corporations.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
Haibu is built using cutting-edge Web3 technologies to ensure decentralization, scalability, and security:  
- **Chopin Framework & Celestia** → Enables modular blockchain infrastructure and decentralization.  
- **Next.js** → Provides a fast, scalable, and interactive front-end experience.  
- **SQL** → Manages structured data efficiently to ensure smooth user interactions.  

## 🔮 Project Future  
Our focus is on delivering a solid and functional **MVP** by the end of **Celestia´s Mammothon**, which will include the core social networking features, DAO governance prototype, and engagement system.  

Future iterations will introduce:  
- **🚀 UX/UI Enhancements:** Improving design and user experience based on community feedback.  
- **🔐 Advanced Security Measures:** Strengthening privacy controls and data protection.  
- **📈 Monetization Expansion:** Introducing **subscription plans** and **targeted advertising** as key revenue streams.  
- **🌍 Community Tools:** Developing additional governance mechanisms and interactive features to expand Haibu’s ecosystem.  

## 💰 Monetization Strategy  
Haibu will generate revenue through a **hybrid monetization model** that balances user experience and sustainability:  
- **Premium Subscription Model:** Users can opt for a **paid subscription** to access exclusive features and enjoy an ad-free experience.  
- **Targeted Advertising for Non-Premium Users:** Businesses and projects can sponsor **ads** displayed to non-premium users, ensuring a sustainable income stream while maintaining user privacy and decentralization principles.
